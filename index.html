				Elvis Aaron Presley(January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American musician and actor. 
				Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often 
				referred to as "the King of Rock and Roll", or simply, "the King".

				Presley is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century. Commercially                   successful in many genres, including pop, blues and gospel, he is the best-selling solo artist in the               history of recorded music,with estimated   record sales of around 600 million units worldwide.He won three         Grammys, also receiving the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into                 multiple music halls of fame.

				Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, as a twinless twin, and when he was 13 years old, 
				he and his family relocated to Memphis, Tennessee. His music career began there in 1954,
				when he recorded a song with producer Sam Phillips at Sun Records. Accompanied by guitarist 
				Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was an early popularizer of rockabilly, an 
				uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues.

				RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, 
				who managed the singer for more than two decades.Presley's first RCA single,
				"Heartbreak Hotel", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. 
				He was regarded as the leading figure of rock and roll after a series of successful network 
				television appearances and chart-topping records. His energized interpretations of songs and 
				sexually provocative performance style,combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across 
				color lines that coincided with the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement, made him enormously 
				popular—and controversial.

				In November 1956, he made his film debut in Love Me Tender. In 1958, he was drafted into 
				military service. He 
				resumed his recording career two years later, producing some of his most commercially successful 
				work before devoting much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and their accompanying soundtrack 
				albums, most of which were critically derided. In 1968,following a seven-year break from live 
				performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed televised comeback special Elvis, which 
				led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973,
				Presley was featured in the first globally broadcast concert via satellite, Aloha from Hawaii.
				Several years of prescription drug abuse  severely damaged his health, and he died in 1977 at 
				the age of 42.

				Presley's earliest musical influence came from gospel. His mother recalled that from the age 
				of two, at the Assembly of God church in Tupelo attended by the family, "he would slide down 
				off my lap, run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform. There he would stand looking at 
				the choir and trying to sing with them".As a teenager, Presley's musical interests were wide-ranging, 
				and he was deeply informed about African American musical idioms as well as white ones 
				(see "Teenage life in Memphis"). Though he never had any formal training, he was blessed with a 
				remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first 
				professional recordings in 1954 at the age of 19. When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met him two 
				years later, they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues.At a press 
				conference the following year, he proudly declared, "I know practically every religious song that's 
				ever been written."

				Presley was known for a life of luxury and excess, as exemplified by his estate at Graceland. 
				He owned a number of expensive cars, including three pink Cadillacs, immortalized in his version 
				of the song "Baby,Let's Play House", in which Presley replaced the line "you may get religion" with 
				"you may have a Pink Cadillac".A number of stories, both real and exaggerated, detail Presley's 
				appetite for rich or heavy food.He was said to enjoy the Southern cuisine of his upbringing, 
				including chicken-fried steak and biscuits and gravy.Presley is commonly associated with rich 
				sandwiches, including the Fool's Gold Loafand peanut butter,banana and bacon sandwiches,now  
				ommonly called an "Elvis sandwich".
